Over time, historical data collected by sensors can be used to identify fill patterns, optimize driver routes and schedules, and reduce operational costs. The cost of these sensors is steadily decreasing, making IoT waste bins more feasible to implement and more attractive to city leaders. \n More Info:  <a href=\"https://www.iotforall.com/smart-waste-management\">Visit Google</a>"],
